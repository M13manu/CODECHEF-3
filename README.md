# Programme to check the validity of a Phone number
* We first ask the user to enter a country code.
* We then check if the country code is valid or not.
* If the country code is not valid, we ask the user to enter a valid country code.
* If the country code is valid, we ask the user to enter a mobile number.
* If the mobile number is valid, we print the mobile number as valid.
* If the mobile number is not valid, we print the mobile number as invalid.
